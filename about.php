	A Word From the Founder:</h2>
<p>
	From age 10 I&#39;ve been fascinated with computers. At age 11 I disassembled and re-assembled my first computer. By 13 I was re-installing operating systems and upgrading internal components for friends and relatives. I spent my entire adolesence and yound adult life working for big box retailers. During those years I built countless gaming and business machines for clients throughout the KW region. With over 10 years of combined sales and computer technician experience I&#39;m confident that LiquidTec has the solid roots it needs to succeed.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Our goal is simple; to succeed where the big box retailers fail. True customer service, without having worry about duping someone into paying for <strong>OUR&nbsp;</strong>high operating costs. Our pledge is to remain at 10% of the operating costs of a big box store. This is how we&#39;re able to bring you exemplary service at rock bottom prices.<br />
	<br />
	We thrive on seeing customer satisfaction. Part of that is our round-the-clock service. If we need to get your system up and running at 11pm at night when all the big box stores are closed we&#39;re there.<br />
	<br />
	Let us provide you with Endless Computing Solutions.</p>
